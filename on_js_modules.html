tl;dr;

Modularise: write small modules that do only one thing, and compose them together to do more complex stuff.

Requirejs on multipage apps:

https://github.com/requirejs/example-multipage
https://github.com/requirejs/example-multipage-shim (shim needed to load backbone/underscore/etc)
http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/11/18/a-require-dot-js-multipage-shimmed-site-how-to/
re ^, this was very useful: https://github.com/robdodson/requirejs-multipage-shim-tutorial

Rob Dodson: "When working with a multi-page site compiling everything into one file is probably not a good idea because you have no guarantee that the user will visit every page. Thus the ideal scenario is one in which each page has its own main file that contains page-specific instructions and then a separate (hopefully cached) file which contains all of the commonly used js libs. For example if you have a page called About and a page called Contact you would have main-about.js and main-contact.js. Let’s say main-about.js and main-contact.js both require 'jquery' and 'underscore'. We wouldn’t want to compile jquery and underscore into each main file because then we’re creating unnecessary bloat. Instead we should create a common.js file which contains jquery and underscore and we’ll make sure that this file loads before any of our main files."

on require-jquery.js:
via requirejs.org: Previously, we've been pointing to an example using a special require-jquery file, which consisted of require.js and jQuery concatenated. This is no longer the recommended way to use jQuery with require.js, but if you're looking for the (no longer maintained) example, you can find require-jquery here.




AMD vs CommonJS
Why AMD is better, with examples:
http://blog.millermedeiros.com/amd-is-better-for-the-web-than-commonjs-modules/
- AMD modules are flexible.
- Plugin support (extremely useful and powerful).
- Can load more than just JavaScript files.
- Path aliases and other advanced config settings to simplify path resolution and dependency listing.
- Works in the browser without a build (most popular AMD loaders supports this feature).
- Is asynchronous by nature.
- Works in current browsers, no need to wait for Harmony.
- Dependencies are usually listed on the same location making it easy to identify what are the dependencies.
- Avoid globals by default since modules are wrapped by closures.
- Can run the same code on both environments by simply using an AMD loader that works on a CJS environment (see r.js and amdefine).
- It’s being adopted by popular JavaScript libraries like Dojo (1.6+), Mootools (2.0), jQuery (1.7)…
- Lazy-load scripts if needed.

AMD Example:
// Path alias to simplify module look-up and file versioning (really important feature):
// configure RequireJS/curljs paths
require.config({
    //set base folder of all dependencies
    baseUrl : 'js',
    paths : {
        //avoid typing long path all the time
        'foo' : 'lib/lorem-ipsum/dolor/foo',
        //version file for cache busting
        'lorem/ipsum' : 'lorem/ipsum-v23'
    }
});
define(['foo/bar', 'lorem/ipsum'], function(bar, ipsum){
    //this will load 'js/lib/lorem-ipsum/dolor/foo/bar.js'
    //and 'js/lorem/ipsum-v23.js'
});

- Don’t enforce a build step during development (even if automatic), one of the beauties of developing JavaScript is that you can simply refresh the browser to see the updates, run the build task only for deployment (combine and minify files to reduce number of requests and increase load performance).

- AMD greatest benefit isn’t being able to load scripts on-demand, as some people may think, the greatest benefit is the increase of the code organization/modularity and also the reduced need for globals/namespacing.
