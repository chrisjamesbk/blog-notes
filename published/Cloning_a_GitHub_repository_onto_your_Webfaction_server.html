<p>As I've mentioned before, my preferred solution for web hosting is <a href="http://www.webfaction.com?affiliate=chrisjames03">Webfaction</a>, and I couldn't be happier. The control panel is easy to use, full shell access with SSH is a default, it's quick and easy to set up new domains and apps (for example, creating a wordpress app takes literally seconds), the customer service has been great and the price is right.</p>
<p>I recently discovered that WebFaction also plays nice with GitHub, although it takes a little bit of setting up. What I wanted to do was to clone a GitHub repo straight onto my Webfaction server, and to then be able to pull any changes to the repo straight across. This article guides you through the steps I needed to take, from the generation of a new SSH key through to cloning and updating my repo. I borrowed heavily from <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">this guide from github:help</a>.</p>
<pre class="command-line">
# login to the Webfaction shell with SSH

$ cd ~/.ssh
# move to the .ssh directory in the root of your server

$ ls
# lists all the subdirectories

$ mkdir key_backup
# makes a key_backup subdirectory

$ cp id_dsa* key_backup
# copies the id_dsa keypair into key_backup
# note: you might have an id_rsa keypair instead of id_dsa. change the command as appropriate.

$ rm id_dsa*
# deletes the id_dsa keypair

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your-username@web122.webfaction.com"
# creates a new ssh key with your webfaction email
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/chrisjames03/.ssh/id_rsa): [press return]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [enter passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [and again]
Your identification has been saved in /home/your-username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/your-username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
aa:00:1a:1a:1a:a1:1a:1a:aa:aa:a1:1a:1a:11:1a:11 your-username@web122.webfaction.com

$ vi id_rsa.pub
# opens the id_rsa.pub keypair with vim
# copy the key, making sure to select all characters and not add/remove spaces
</pre>
<p>Now add your SSH key to Github. See the steps in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">Step 4</a> of this handy guide.</p>
<p>That <em>should</em> be it! Now it's time to clone a GitHub repository into your Webfaction webapp. You will need to create the app in your Webfaction control panel before proceeding with the next step.</p>
<p>Note that <code>git</code> is <a href="http://docs.webfaction.com/software/git.html">already installed</a> on your Webfaction server (another win!). So unless you plan on hosting your git repo's on your server, it is unnecessary to install the git web application.</p>
<pre class="command-line">
$ cd ../webapps/nameofwebapp/
# change directory to your webapp

$ git clone git@github.com:github-username/github-repo.git ./
# clones your github repo into the webapp directory at the root level (not a subdirectory)
Cloning into ....

<p>Now that you have successfully cloned your GitHub repo onto your Webfaction server, you will need to keep it up-to-date as and when you commit changes...</p>

$ git pull origin
