<p>Ostensibly this <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670550/the-next-big-idea-from-twitters-founders-pinterest-basically">article by Kyle Vanhemert</a> on co.Design is about the latest hot new product on the web, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>. However, I can't tell you what Medium is, and I'm disinclined to learn. That's because Medium requires you to join a service without giving any information on its homepage about what it is you are signing up for. This stinks of marketing and <em>buzz-generation</em>, and I refuse to do it. Rant over.</p>
<p>Back to the article. Vanhemert asserts that Medium is basically a Pinterest clone, both in terms of managing content but also its "tile-based" design. Since it became popular, Pinterest has inspired a slew of sites whose content is organized in the now familiar grid &emdash; this being at odds with the predominantly vertical "river of news" model that dominated previous iterations of "the web".</p>
<p>Vanhemert goes on to discuss the relative merits of the grid-style layout versus the traditional vertical model:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Unlike those earlier blogs which put every new post above the last and encouraged readers to flick through at top-speed, the Pinterest-style grid forces the eye to zig-zag through content, slowing down your scrolling but packing more images onto the screen at any given point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, tiles are "inefficient" for news content, where the timeline is of great importance. On the other hand, for scanning thumbnails the grid is much more efficient. Vanhemert argues that this is because the grid encourages the user to linger, thus emphasising "emotional heft" over "transactional speed". The user is encouraged to "consider objects as a group instead of discrete items". The objects as a group create additional context that makes the experience more compelling. He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There’s also something about the grid and tiles, on a visceral level, that just feels more cohesive and still lively [...] grids put all the focus on the content. It’s equal parts organized and overwhelming. There’s so much visual stuff on your screen, you can’t help but feel like someone has designed the experience for you. The tiles impart a sense of curation--and thus, human emotion--to the content.</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>Grids are here to stay then. However, we are far away from pronouncing the death of the "river". After all, <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/why-long-page">another trend</a> in web design at the moment is the movement towards using a single, long page design. And as Vanhemert adds:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Scanning may be easier than scrolling, but scrolling’s still easier than scanning and clicking, and that extra click is necessary any time you want to jump from a short text preview to a full story or blog post.</p>
