<p>Over the past year or so, I had been slowly falling out of love with the Wordpress platform, specifically with using Wordpress as a straight up CMS.</p>
Why?
- bloat
- admin is hard to use
- sometimes flaky
- my friend got hacked, probably because of a plugin

<p>However, I just finished a big client project where I considered a bunch of CMS's and I ended up doing WP. So what changed? There were many considerations, but the foremost amongst them was that I discovered the "best plugin ever!!!", <a href="">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF). What's so awesome about ACF? etc. Feeling better about security (another post to follow), also WP updates, better assessment of plugins. Other reasons. How I discovered it? - Ryan.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Wordpress is the best solution for all websites, far from it. And some of the problems I have with Wordpress still stand up. But my big realization from this was that Wordpress is a great platform to have in my arsenal. It is so flexible... etc</p>
