"Mobile web navigation must strike a balance between quick access to a site’s information and unobtrusiveness."
http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/
"Ultimately, mobile navigation should be like a good friend: there when you need them, but cool enough to give you your space. A bad friend is someone who’s not there when you need someone to talk to (when navigation is absent or hard to find), or someone who’s obnoxious because they’re always around and taking up space (dude, get off my couch). Finding the balance between accessible navigation and mobile screen real estate is an art that we’re all trying to sort out."

* Top Nav or “Do Nothing” Approach
- Height matters in mobile. As Luke’s book explains, content-first, nav-second is preferred for mobile web experiences. You want to get the users to the meat-and-potatoes content as quickly as possible. That means getting the navigation out of user’s way so they can focus on the core information on the page.

* The Footer Anchor
- This clever solution keeps the nav list at the footer of the site, while the header contains a simple anchor link pointing to the footer nav. This approach clears up a lot of room for the core content while still providing quick access to the navigation.
- Not elegant - A jarring jump, while awesomely practical, isn’t the elegant interaction mobile users have gotten used to from interacting with those highly-polished native apps

* The Select Menu
- Transform a list of links into a select menu for small screens
- Ugly - select menus are a pain in the ass to style
- Native overrides, e.g. mobile Safari

* The Toggle
- This is basically what we do now with the category and profile dropdown menus

* The Left Nav Flyout
- Facebook popularized a left navigation for mobile that’s quite unique. The nav is accessed by a menu icon, which reveals a tray that slides in from the left and moves the main content over to the right.
- this approach provides a lot of space to expand
- Don't forget progressive enhancement: http://stephanierieger.com/a-plea-for-progressive-enhancement/ As Stephanie Rieger pointed out, the Obama site navigation broke on everything but the most sophisticated devices.
- this method is quite unique to mobile and doesn’t necessarily scale up to large screens easily
- Do we need the hint of content on the right? - When I first saw Facebook’s new mobile nav, I actually thought it was broken. Keeping a hint of the content on the right seems a bit weird to me, but this is all personal preference.

* The Footer-Only
- Difficult to Discover & Access

* The “Hide N’ Cry”
- By removing the nav for small screens, you free up a lot of space! But that comes at a cost...

* Pull Down for Navigation http://inspectelement.com/tutorials/pull-down-for-navigation-a-responsive-solution/
- Potentially confusing- Mobile users are used to pulling down the top of the page to refresh a list of content items, not to reveal a navigation
- Explicit Instruction Required- you have to explicitly tell the user to pull down to reveal the nav

"What are your experience’s key sections? Where are people spending most of their time? Do you really need your privacy policy in your primary navigation? Focus. Use mobile’s lack of screen real estate to cut through political bullshit (“But I want to be in the nav too!”) and strip away dead weight. Your users will thank you."
"if you have a zillion sections and pages, prioritize search. A search form is an effective way of getting users to where they need to go without having to wade through fifeteen levels of navigation just to get there."

* The Multi-Toggle
- The multi-toggle is basically just nested accordions.
- users can quickly scan parent categories before making a decision to go to the next level

* The Ol’ Right-to-Left
- Instead of sub-nav items appearing underneath the parent category like the multi-toggle, the next level of navigation is offscreen to the right and animates in when requested
- Animation performance varies greatly across different devices and platforms.
- Both case studies listed no longer do this. Must be a maintainability nightmare.

* The ‘Skip the Sub-Nav’
- Sub-navigation typically includes items that are also included on the parent category’s landing page. Because that content is accessible on the landing pages, it’s perfectly viable to simply take small screen users straight to the landing page and let them make their next move from there.
- Context specific navigation, e.g. only show sub-categories on category pages
- Having to go to an entirely separate page isn’t terribly efficient for quick navigation.

* Priority+
- Show less important links with a "+ more" button

* Seperate Pages
- Top level navigation (e.g. categories) links to separate pages with secondary (e.g. sub-cats) navigation
- Simple to implement/maintain (fewer moving parts)

A bunch of Retail Navigation Patterns documented here:
http://www.slideshare.net/theresaneil/mobile-retail-navigation-patterns

http://www.mobiledesignpatterngallery.com/mobile-patterns.php

THOUGHTS
- seperate navigation options on different pages
- all options always available, but hidden, e.g. LNF


CASE STUDIES

Abercrombie
- seperate mobile site
- header: nav icon, logo, settings, cart
- landing page: marketing, top-level category nav, special offers
- nav icon click = 'left nav flyout' (LNF)
- drag-to-left has no effect
- clicking on top-level categories also enables LNF, filtered by category
- LNF: categories, account, help/about/contact
- LNF: categories have own LNF page with subcategories
- LNF: sub-subcategories are shown with accordion
- product page nav: LNF accessible, category breadcrumb

CALVIN KLEIN
- seperate mobile site
- header: logo, search
- sub-header: home, my account, cart
- landing page: marketing, top-level category nav, contact, social
- category pages feature subcategories listed, with sub-subcats shown with accordion

GILT
- mobile site
- header: top level categories (4) and '+ More' button (fixed = always visible)

- product page feels like part of the browse categories experience, as you drill down
- product page nav: breadcrumb, "more like this" links

LOWE'S
- mobile site
- header: nav icon, search (open), logo, account, cart (fixed, except product page)
- sub-header: toggles on click between search bar (default) and main nav (store, shop, help) (search is fixed, main nav is overlay)
- landing page: promotions, very visual, footer (social, company links)
- 'shop' link takes you to list of categories
- click on categories to open sub-category pages with breadcrumb (only one level back)
- product page has no additional nav except 'back to top'

ZAPPOS
- mobile site
- header: logo, profile, loves, cart
- sub-header: search
- refined browse (choose - product type, gender, third option dependent on first two)
- more like a structured search

SVPPLY
- native app
- header: page title (feed), @ (mentions), nav icon
- click on nav icon, reveals nav (you, feed, shop, search)
- you = profile page

- shop = filter by category, categories listed as LNF. subcats show as accordion, act like filters. hide/show categories with slide left/right
- when viewing product grid, scroll up to show additional popular/price filters
- filter by location also available in header on browse page
- offer page nav: simple, back to feed, share, nav icon


Primary Questions:
What are key sections? Where are people spending most of their time? Where do we want people to go? SOCIAL FIRST
What can we strip away? Free up screen space.
What needs to always be there? e.g. logo, cart? Logo not necessarily(actually yes, deep links), cart yes
What nav elements always need to be available, but can be hidden
Are there nav elements that always need to be present on a specific page? e.g. browse page filters, sub-cat lists
Start with one/two levels of header open? Immediate access vs screen real estate.
Fixed header? Back to top link?
Can we get rid of footer? Do we want to? (adds visual cue that end of page, slim it down, no duplication)
Simple and maintainable vs. "Wow" factor, everything always available (balance)
Navigation: on top/overlay (e.g. Gucci)? LNF (e.g. Abercrombie? new page (e.g. ikea)? drop down (e.g sony)?
What levels of categories do we need to drill down to? (assuming 2 per current site)
Requests for category sub-nav. Does this need to be done by ajax, per current nav?
Progressive enhancement - what if javascript is turned off? Do we care?
Homepage (almost exclusively) for navigation? Or Feed = Home? (would require new page, but easier to maintain as nav cleaner elsewhere?)
What do we need to accomodate Merchant Portal?


Secondary Questions:
Clever use of colors, e.g. svpply category nav
Notifications in nav?
Hide browser chrome/header element as you scroll down
Pull down to refresh? - expected on the Feed
Incorporate touch gestures? - nice to have
Do we need to include credits in main nav? - not mobile


Limitations:
Settings has to be a seperate, native page

- check out Gilt app - carousel-esque
- can search results be predictive (live search)
- search in lnf
- top level = tabs
