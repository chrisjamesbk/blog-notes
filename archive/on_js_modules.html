<p>In June, I went to Portland, OR to attend the jQuery Conference. Amongst the many things I took away from the event, the overarching theme seemed to be modular (object oriented) javascript. As a "SMACSS guy", I've long been a convert to modular CSS, but modular javascript wasn't something I'd read much about. Since then I've fully embraced the concept, and my code is cleaner, more maintainable and easier to understand.</p>
<p>I wanted to share a couple of great articles for anyone else looking to enhance their javascript code. They should give you a nice background into the subject, as well as a few examples to go away and hack around with.</p>

<h3><a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2009/10/15/using-objects-to-organize-your-code/">Using Objects to Organize Your Code - Rebecca Murphey</a></h3>
<p>This article by Rebecca Murphey is a great introduction to writing object-oriented javascript. She describes in easy-to-follow steps, targeted at novice-to-intermediate level javascript developers, how to transition from simple jQuery snippets to clear, well-organized javascript modules using the object literal pattern. Of particular note is how Murphey talks about the need to "think at the outset about what your code will do and what pieces need to be in place in order for you to do it" and she outlines a step in her process of "Scaffolding the Object" which helps to make the rest of her tutorial clear and concise.</p>

<h3><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-design-of-code-organizing-javascript">The Design of Code: Organizing JavaScript - Anthony Colangelo</a></h3>
<p>Colangelo's article for A List Apart expands Murphey's writing on the object literal pattern, introducing the module pattern and explaining how it increases the maintainability and reusability of his code. He talks a lot about how this decoupling of code into independent methods and properties within a module is great for building solid systems architecture. He also outlines the process of wrapping modules inside a jQuery plugin, thereby increasing reusability, providing robust options and exposing a well-crafted API. Doing so can also provide helpful cues to other developers about the nature of your module - improving the "developer interface".</p>
<p>Although this article is a nice introduction to the jQuery plugin module pattern, I would strongly recommend supplementing your understanding by examining the code of <a href="https://github.com/acolangelo/jPanelMenu/blob/master/jquery.jpanelmenu.js">jPanelMenu</a>, the plugin that Colangelo authored and mentions in the article. You'll see a more "real life" implementation of the techniques described in the plugin.</p>
<p>The pattern Colangelo describes is now my go-to for writing modular javascript. For more advanced reading on the subject, I also recommend Addy Osmani's book on javascript patterns, and in particular the chapter on the <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript">module pattern</a>.</p>

tl;dr;

Modularise: write small modules that do only one thing, and compose them together to do more complex stuff.

re ^, this was very useful: https://github.com/robdodson/requirejs-multipage-shim-tutorial

Rob Dodson: "When working with a multi-page site compiling everything into one file is probably not a good idea because you have no guarantee that the user will visit every page. Thus the ideal scenario is one in which each page has its own main file that contains page-specific instructions and then a separate (hopefully cached) file which contains all of the commonly used js libs. For example if you have a page called About and a page called Contact you would have main-about.js and main-contact.js. Let’s say main-about.js and main-contact.js both require 'jquery' and 'underscore'. We wouldn’t want to compile jquery and underscore into each main file because then we’re creating unnecessary bloat. Instead we should create a common.js file which contains jquery and underscore and we’ll make sure that this file loads before any of our main files."

on require-jquery.js:
via requirejs.org: Previously, we've been pointing to an example using a special require-jquery file, which consisted of require.js and jQuery concatenated. This is no longer the recommended way to use jQuery with require.js, but if you're looking for the (no longer maintained) example, you can find require-jquery here.




AMD vs CommonJS
Why AMD is better, with examples:
http://blog.millermedeiros.com/amd-is-better-for-the-web-than-commonjs-modules/
- AMD modules are flexible.
- Plugin support (extremely useful and powerful).
- Can load more than just JavaScript files.
- Path aliases and other advanced config settings to simplify path resolution and dependency listing.
- Works in the browser without a build (most popular AMD loaders supports this feature).
- Is asynchronous by nature.
- Works in current browsers, no need to wait for Harmony.
- Dependencies are usually listed on the same location making it easy to identify what are the dependencies.
- Avoid globals by default since modules are wrapped by closures.
- Can run the same code on both environments by simply using an AMD loader that works on a CJS environment (see r.js and amdefine).
- It’s being adopted by popular JavaScript libraries like Dojo (1.6+), Mootools (2.0), jQuery (1.7)…
- Lazy-load scripts if needed.

AMD Example:
// Path alias to simplify module look-up and file versioning (really important feature):
// configure RequireJS/curljs paths
require.config({
    //set base folder of all dependencies
    baseUrl : 'js',
    paths : {
        //avoid typing long path all the time
        'foo' : 'lib/lorem-ipsum/dolor/foo',
        //version file for cache busting
        'lorem/ipsum' : 'lorem/ipsum-v23'
    }
});
define(['foo/bar', 'lorem/ipsum'], function(bar, ipsum){
    //this will load 'js/lib/lorem-ipsum/dolor/foo/bar.js'
    //and 'js/lorem/ipsum-v23.js'
});

- Don’t enforce a build step during development (even if automatic), one of the beauties of developing JavaScript is that you can simply refresh the browser to see the updates, run the build task only for deployment (combine and minify files to reduce number of requests and increase load performance).

- AMD greatest benefit isn’t being able to load scripts on-demand, as some people may think, the greatest benefit is the increase of the code organization/modularity and also the reduced need for globals/namespacing.
