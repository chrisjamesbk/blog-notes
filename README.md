Blog Notes
==========

I have a little web development/design/ux blog powered by Tumblr. 

It lives over at http://chrisjamesbk.tumblr.com/

I've been writing there for over a year now, and my draft folder has grown a little unmanageable. I decided to move over some of my more fleshed out article ideas into a text editor. And now I'm going to use Github to back them up.
